## Project Status

Unfortunately, due to life events, I haven't been able to update Dexterous much recently.  So I've decided to open source the entire project in hopes that others will be able to help contribute and make Dexterous the best Pokedex tracking app available.  
### How Can I Help?
The most important update is, of course, updating the database and lists of Pokemon.  When I first created this app, I used [Veekun's excellent work](https://veekun.com/) to create and populate the database of Pokemon.  For some time there was not an update available for newer generations, however it appears that some updates are being made for Sword and Shield now and perhaps we can pull from their work to update Dexterous.  [Veekun's github can be viewed here](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex).  I'm open to any other ideas as well :).
Other than the data, I'm sure the Android app itself could be updated, fixed, and made more stable.  It's been a while since I seriously wrote an Android app and I'm definitely rusty.  Feel free to contribute by updating the app code itself.  Pull requests are welcome :).
